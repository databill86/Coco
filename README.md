Welcome to Automated Core Course Schedulling's Documentation!
=============================================================

Project overview

The Computer Science department offers about 6 to 12 core courses each semester. To schedule this courses, a huge number of constraints have to be considered, e.g. availability of rooms,
number of estimated participants, no overlap with other core courses or courses belonging to the same field of study and many more. In addition some time slots are favored (e.g. Tue, Thu 10-12)
than others (Mo 8-10, Fr 4-6). The aim of this project is to develop a web based system that is browser independent, having a user friendly and interactive graphical user interface to help
schedule the core courses. The system is expected to serve as the link between the lecturers and the study coordinator.
The system should be able to provide lecturers options which fulfil as many requirements as possible while avoiding strong inconveniences. All constraints must be clearly identified
and algorithms that enable the lecturer and the study coordinator to interact efficiently should be developed. These algorithms should therefore optimize the scheduling process.
Also a database should be incorporated and the front ends should be coded.

Scope of the project

	This project group is expected to develop a web-based system that is able to automate the scheduling of core courses in the computer science department. The system should be functional enough for the lectures to submit their preferences for core courses they are teaching in each semester. Considering the predefined constraints, the study coordinator should get a suggestion how time slots, venues and other applicable logistics should be.

The project is intended to develop a system which is web based, browser independent and using a GUI to help automate scheduling of core courses. The system should be the link between the
lecturers and the study coordinators, such that the lecturers can choose their preffered time slots
and the system gives schedule suggestions to the coordinator based on the predefined constraints
and coordinator defined constraints.
